# Settings

## Arguments and ENV variables

The following can be used to change some of the settings in the application. Arguments are passed to the application by using `--<argument>=<value>` when running the application. ENV variables are mostly for Docker but can be set locally on your system.

NOTE: Argument and ENV should be able to be used interchangeably. If you have issues with the ENV, use the argument value in its place.

| Argument | ENV | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| webroot | WEB_ROOT | Change the base URL of the web app. Ex - `/lounge` |
| webapp_port | WEB_PORT | Change the port the web app uses. Defaults to `8088` |
| accessUrl | WEB_ACCESSURL | Set the URL the web app uses for things like invites. Ex - `http://mysynclounge.com/<webroot>` (if webroot is set) |
| autoJoin | AUTOJOIN_ENABLED | Set to `true` to enable auto joining. Defaults to `false` |
| autoJoinServer | AUTOJOIN_SERVERURL | Set this to the server URL you want the user to auto join. Required if auto join is enabled. Ex - `http://mysynclounge.com/slserver` |
| autoJoinRoom | AUTOJOIN_ROOM | Set this to the room name in the server that you want the users to auto join. Optional |
| autoJoinPassword | AUTOJOIN_PASSWORD | Set this to the room's password, if it has one. Optional |
| authentication | AUTHENTICATION | Configure authentication for the server. See below for more information. Optional |
| customServer | CUSTOM_SERVER | Override the custom server entry in the servers list. See below for more information. Optional |
| servers | SERVERS | Set your own servers list. See below for more information. Optional |
| serverroot | SERVER_ROOT | Change the base URL of the server app. Ex - `/server`. Defaults to `/slserver` |
| server_port | SERVER_PORT | Change the port the server app uses. Defaults to `8089` |

## Authentication

To enable authentication, the following setting and format is used

```json
"authentication": {
    "mechanism": "plex",
    "type": ["server", "user"],
    "authorized": [
      "PLEX_SERVER_MACHINE_ID",
      "PLEX_USER_EMAIL",
      "PLEX_USER_NAME",
    ]
  }
```

- `mechanism` specifies how SyncLounge should authenticate a user. This is mostly for future-proofing to allow other authentication mechanisms to be provided. Defaults to `none`.
- `type` is mechanism dependent. Since `plex` is the only one currently, either or both `server` and `user` can be specified.
  - `server` checks against the plex server machine ID (`PLEX_SERVER_MACHINE_ID`). If the user has access to a server matching any of the IDs in the `authorized` list, they will be granted access. See the "Youâ€™ll Need Your Token" and "Base Server Capabilities" in [Plex's "Plex Media Server URL Commands" Article](https://support.plex.tv/articles/201638786-plex-media-server-url-commands/) to get the `machineIdentifier` for your server. You can also use `https://plex.tv/pms/servers.xml?includeHttps=1&X-Plex-Token=YourTokenGoesHere` to get the machine identifiers for any of the servers your account has access to.
  - `user` checks against the user's email (`PLEX_USER_EMAIL`) or username (`PLEX_USER_NAME`). If either matches a value in the `authorized` list, they will be granted access.
- `authorized` is a list of information for who is authorized.

## Customize the server list

## Server object

The servers list can be modified with your own entry for just the Custom Server in the servers list or for the entire list of servers.

The full server object looks like this:

```json
{
    "name": "",
    "location": "",
    "url": "",
    "image": "",
    "defaultRoom": "",
    "defaultPassword": ""
  }
```

- `name` specifies the text for the name.
- `location` specifies the text for the location.
- `url` specifies the server url. This should match your SyncLounge server URL and will look like `http(s)://<DOMAIN or IP:PORT>/<SERVERROOT>`
- `image` specifies the URL of the image to use.

A server object can also handle a default Room, with or without password. If set, SyncLounge will attempt to auto-join the room when the server is selected by the user.

- `defaultRoom` specifies the name of the room to send the user to after clicking "Connect"
- `defaultPassword` specifies the password for the room above, if provided.

### Customize the Custom Server entry

The Custom Server entry can be modified by adding this to your settings. This takes a single server object and will override the the custom server in the server list.

```json
"customServer": {
  "name": "Custom Server 1",
  "location": "Custom Location",
  "url": "https://mycustomserver.com/slserver",
  "image": "https://mycustomserver.com/logo.png"
}
```

### Customize the entire list

The entire servers list can be modified with your own list of servers. If this setting is provided, it will ignore the `customServer` setting above. Also, if only one server is provided, it will automatically join it!

```json
"servers": [
  {
    "name": "Custom Server 1",
    "location": "Custom Location",
    "url": "https://1.mycustomserver.com/slserver",
    "image": "https://mycustomserver.com/logo.png"
  },
  {
    "name": "Custom Server 2",
    "location": "Custom Location",
    "url": "https://2.mycustomserver.com/slserver",
    "image": "https://mycustomserver.com/logo-2.png",
    "defaultRoom": "DefaultRoom"
  },
  {
    "name": "Custom Server 3",
    "location": "Custom Location",
    "url": "https://3.mycustomserver.com/slserver",
    "image": "https://mycustomserver.com/logo-3.png",
    "defaultRoom": "DefaultRoom",
    "defaultPassword": "DefaultPassword123"
  }
]
```
